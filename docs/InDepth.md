# Problem/Introduction

Detecting fake/real news is a challenging problem and one w/ particular relevance as propaganda has become prevalent.  We see zombie sites appearing via grassroot projects such as [MassMove](https://github.com/MassMove/AttackVectors).  Additionally, we are challenged by the notion of an objective truth that does not contain a highly polarized political bias.  

We have some tools we can use e.g. [academic classes](https://callingbullshit.org) and other apps like [credder](https://credder.com/) and non profits such as [fullfact](https://fullfact.org).  There is past work being done in automating this detection of fake news [Wang 2017, Zellers 2019, Pérez-Rosas 2017].

Significant work has been done in the area of Sarcasm and Sentiment detection in NLP(e.g. [Poria 2016]).  Significantly, we can also detect political bias [Rao 2016].
